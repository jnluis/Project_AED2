## Project 2 - Word ladder
> A word ladder is a sequence of words in which two adjacent words differ by one letter. For example, in English, it is
possible to go from head to tail in five steps: head --> heal --> teal --> tell --> tall --> tail. In Portuguese, we can go
from tudo to nada in four: tudo --> todo --> nodo --> nado --> nada.</br>
>
> Tasks: </br>
> 1. Present a complete functionally correct implementation of the hash table, including code
that dynamically resizes the hash table array when more stuff is added to the hash table. 
> 2. Build the graph (including union-find data).
> 3. Implement breadth-first search in the graph.
> 4. List all words belonging to a connected component.
> 5. Find the shortest path between to words.
> 6. Compute the diameter of a connected component and list the longest word chain.
> 7. Print some statistics about the graph
> 8. Test for memory leaks
